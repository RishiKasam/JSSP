Job Shop Scheduling Problem is a widely studied combinatorial, NP hard optimization problem. The aim of the problem is to allocating shared resources over time to competing activitiesÂ in order to reduce the overall time (makespan) needed to complete all activities. We have n number of Jobs and m number of Machines and these jobs need to be completed using these machines. Each job has its own sequence or specific order in which it needs to be completed.
